- [x] Apply some filters to files that begin with [BIOS] on them.
- [x] Build a class composed of both the ROM title and its ROM set with helper methods.
- [x] Improve error-handling with custom error classes.
    - 3xx codes will be sftp-related errors.
    - 2xx codes will be file-related errors.
    - 1xx codes will be app-related errors.
- [x] Don't connect to Steam Deck if there are ANY .failed.txt files pending to be processed.
- [x] Log duplicates and scrapped ROMs into their own files duplicates.txt and scrapped.txt.
- [x] Work with a more formal `Device` class. It should hold the device name, directory paths, list of console names (to process and filter), and `Consoles` object.
- [x] Relate each device to a unique set of consoles to filter and update. Not all devices would want to filter and update all consoles.
- [x] Move some of the path constants to environment variables.
- [x] Environment variable that holds all devices to process.
- [x] Add a `SIMULATE_SYNC` environment variable to simulate additions/deletions.
    - For the local device, we would simulate the creation and deletion of symlinks by just logging what would happen.
    - For the steam-deck device, we would simulate the transfer of new files and remote deletion by just logging what would happen. For this to work, we would still need the steam deck to be connected.
- [x] Write helper for `fs.readdir`.
- [x] Instead of "skipping" consoles, make sure that all console dirs are available.
- [x] Finish implementation of `devices.syncLocal()`.
- [x] Copy over the `Logger` object I built for better logging support.
- [x] Add a new `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control log levels.
- [x] Explore (and implement) the idea of letting `Device` be an interface, or an abstract class (think this through).
- [x] Create two new classes that extend/implement `Device`: `Local` and `SteamDeck`.
- [x] Let the `devices/<device>/failed/` subfolder host two new subfolders: `failed/roms`, and `failed/media`.
