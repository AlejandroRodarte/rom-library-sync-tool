- [ ] Add a `SIMULATE_SYNC` environment variable to simulate additions/deletions.
    - For the local device, we would simulate the creation and deletion of symlinks by just logging what would happen.
    - For the steam-deck device, we would simulate the transfer of new files and remote deletion by just logging what would happen. For this to work, we would still need the steam deck to be connected.
- [ ] Improve logging in the overall codebase.
- [ ] Add SFTP code to connect to the Steam Deck. Credentials should be stored in a git-ignored .env file.
- [ ] After adding/removing files to/from Steam Deck, updates all console `gameslist.xml` to update ES-DE's metadata.
- [ ] Write helper for `fs.readdir`.
- [ ] Some games have different titles, but actually refer to the same game.
    - Example: For the Atari 2600, files `Action Man - Action Force (Europe).a26` and `G.I. Joe - Cobra Strike (USA).a26` refer to the same game, named `Action Force` in ES-DE.
    - The `Action Force` title name is actually found in the `atari2600/gameslist.xml` file.
    - We should add some logic to bundle up these ROMs by their ES-DE title instead of their filename title.
    - A quick idea would be to map the `gamelists.xml` file into a JSON object we can use to search for the filename.
    - If an ES-DE title name exists for the filename, use that title when building our `Titles` entry.
    - If not, then use the filename title as we currently do.
- [ ] Move duplicate code in versioning systems to functions.
- [ ] Migrate ROM labels and languages from arrays to sets.
- [ ] Check if Steam Deck has the last ROM from each diff file.
- [ ] Let failed/ directory have two subdirectories: failed/diffs, and failed/images.
    - Failed diff files will represent all add-file/remove-file operations that failed.
    - Failed image files will represent two scenarios: when we added a file, but did not found its image, and when we deleted a file, but was not able to actually delete it.
