- [x] Apply some filters to files that begin with [BIOS] on them.
- [x] Build a class composed of both the ROM title and its ROM set with helper methods.
- [x] Improve error-handling with custom error classes.
    - 3xx codes will be sftp-related errors.
    - 2xx codes will be file-related errors.
    - 1xx codes will be app-related errors.
- [x] Don't connect to Steam Deck if there are ANY .failed.txt files pending to be processed.
- [ ] Log duplicates and scrapped ROMs into their own files duplicates.txt and scrapped.txt.
- [ ] Work with a more formal `Device` class. It should hold the device name, directory paths, list of console names (to process and filter), and `Consoles` object.
- [ ] Move duplicate code in versioning systems to functions.
- [ ] Migrate ROM labels and languages from arrays to sets.
- [ ] Add SFTP code to connect to the Steam Deck. Credentials should be stored in a git-ignored .env file.
- [ ] Check if Steam Deck has the last ROM from each diff file.
- [ ] Let failed/ directory have two subdirectories: failed/diffs, and failed/images.
    - Failed diff files will represent all add-file/remove-file operations that failed.
    - Failed image files will represent two scenarios: when we added a file, but did not found its image, and when we deleted a file, but was not able to actually delete it.
- [ ] Relate each device to a unique set of consoles to filter and update. Not all devices would want to filter and update all consoles.
